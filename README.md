# Boing-Academic-Project-2019
The Boing project is a project that was set by my university as an assignment that I had to complete. Shortly, the program creates shapes that grow and shrink in size and bounce off the walls of the window. Some of the code was provided by the university to help us complete the desired task. My code can be distinguished by the fact that it has a comment descriptions in the java file following the MR commenting stardard.
